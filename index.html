<p> Welcome to Computational Geometry, Fall 2021!

</p><p>Computational geometry studies algorithms for problems that involve
 geometric data: (finite) sets of points, line segments and
 polygons.

It  is a young and growing field, driven by
applications in graphics, robotics, autonomous vehicles, vision, image
processing, and GIS.

Some classical examples of geometric problems: Is a point inside or
outside a polygon? Do two polygons intersect?  Given a set of points
in the plane, what is the closest pair of points? What is the smallest
convex polygon that contains a set of points in the plane? What are
all the points that fall in a given query range?  What is visible from
a point in a polygon? How many points are sufficient to guard any
polygon?  Given two sets of segments, what are their intersections?
Given a set of points, what is their smallest enclosing circle? Given
a set of polygonal obstacles, and a polygonal robot moving in 2D with
translation and rotation, what is an efficient path between a start
and end location?  And many more. This class is an introduction to
computational geometry and will cover some of the fundamental problems and techniques in the field.

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Data Structures (cs2100), 
Algorithms (cs2200) and Systems (2310).   In other words, knowledge of:
</p><ul>
  <li>basic analysis: asymptotic notation, growth, solving recurrences. 
  </li><li>basic algorithm design techniques: divide-and-conquer, greedy. 
  </li><li>basic algorithms and data structures: searching, sorting, binary search trees,  priority queues. 
  </li><li>basic programming in C/C++
  </li><li>basic Unix, working from a terminal, compiling using a Makefile
</li></ul>

<p><strong>CS curriculum:</strong> This is a 3000-level class that
fullfills the Algorithms/Theory requirement. Although it has lots of
programming, it is <b>not</b> a projects
class.  

</p><p><strong>Discussion forum</strong> We will use <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> to facilitate communication and discussion outside of class. Please try to use this forum and avoid sending  email ---- your classmates  will benefit from seeing everyone else's questions  and answers. You are encouraged to follow the posts on Slack and jump into the discussion. If you want to send me a private message, you can direct message (DM) me on Slack. Another nicer feature of Slack is that you'll be able to create your own channels for group work. 


</p><p><strong>TAs:</strong>
</p><ul>
  <li>n/a (no alums in the pipeline) 
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Office hours:</strong> 
</p><ul>
<li>M, W: 3-4pm
<li>F: 12-2pm
</li></ul> 



<p><strong>Class webpage:</strong>
<i>http://tildesites.bowdoin.edu/~ltoma/teaching/cs3250-CompGeom/fall21/</i>. This
is hosted on my personal website at Bowdoin and will contain all
class-related materials throughout the semester. You can bookmark this page
or you can follow the link from my website. 

We will use the class Blackboard site very minimally. 



</p><p> <strong>Textbooks:</strong>

There is no required textbook. The course is based on two classical
textbooks, below.  You can find them in Searles 224 (you're more than welcome to
read them, but please do not take them out of 224). 
</p><ul> <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Computational-Geometry-Cambridge-Theoretical-Computer/dp/0521649765/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389985599&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=computational+geometry">Computational
  geometry in C. </a> J. O'Rourke.

  </li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Computational-Geometry-Applications-Mark-Berg/dp/3540779736/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_z">Computational geometry: algorithms and applications</a>. Mark de Berg, Otfried
   Cheong, Mark van Kreveld, Mark Overmars.  </li></ul>




<p><strong>Work and Grading: </strong> The work for the class will
come from programming projects (approximately biweekly), with class
engagement/participation serving as a tie breaker. 

<del>The assignments are weighed equally, so each one is worth approx. 14.3% of the final grade.</del>


</p><p><strong>Collaboration policy:</strong>  You can work alone, or you can pair with a
partner (pair-programming).  

   </p><ul>
     <li> <b>Collaboration across teams is at level-1: </b><i> </i> that is, verbal
   collaboration without solution sharing. You are allowed and
   encouraged to discuss ideas with other class members, but the
   communication should be verbal and additionally it can include
   diagrams on board. Noone is allowed to take notes during the
   discussion (being able to recreate the solution later frommemory is
   proof that you actually understood it). Communication cannot
   include sharing pseudocode for the problem. Please read the <a href="https://turing.bowdoin.edu/dept/collab.php">department's
   collaboration policy</a>.


   <p></p></li><li><b>Pair programming policy</b>: <i>If you chose to work with
   a partner, you must work together, physically in the same place,
   for the entire project that you do together. The overall project
   must be a true joint effort, equally owned, created and understood
   by both partners.
   
   Specifically splitting the problem into parts and working on them separately is not allowed and violates the honor code for the class.
   
   If you start together as a team and are unable to complete the project together, then you will each inherit teh shared code, and split up to work individually on the remainder of the project. You would then submit individually, with a note on what happened.
</i>

      
   <p>There are many advantages to working with a partner (e.g. more fun,
   more learning, good skill for the "real world"), and I encourage you
   to try.
   
   You may also consider alternating between working alone and with a
   partner, and changing partners.


   </p><p>Remember that you are responsible for reading, understanding, and adhering to the policy. If you have any questions about any aspects of the policy, please do not hesitate to ask for clarification.
