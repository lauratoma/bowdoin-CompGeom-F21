<h2>Assignment:  3d hull</h2>






<p> In this assignment you will write code to find the convex hull of
a set of points (in 3D) using either gift wrapping, or the incremental
algorithm. You will receive starter code on Github which contains two
versions: one in c and and one in cpp. The code should compile as is,
and provides the graphical interface.




<p><b>Representing the hull:</b> The first question you will need to
answer is how to store the hull.

For simplicity, do not worry about storing the topology of the hull,
that is, the neighboring information for its faces, edges and
vertices.


Store the hull as a list/array/vector of the faces on the hull.
Ideally the faces use pointers to the points, rather than duplicating
the points and their coordinates.  For example, in C style:

<pre>
typedef struct _face3d {
   point3d *p1, *p2, *p3;  //the vertices on this face (in ccw as looking from outside)
} face3d; 
</pre>



<p><b>Starting naive:</b> It's a good idea to start by implementing
the naive algorithm. This will be quick and vizualizing the 3d hull should provide a nice
motivation for getting the basics working.

For simplicity, do not worry about handling degeneracies. 

To test, generate points randomly on the sphere, and compute their
hull.


<!-- <p><b>Degeneracies: </b> If there exist 4 points that are coplanar and -->
<!-- extreme, they will lead to a face of the hull that is a polygon with -->
<!-- more than 3 vertices.  Handling these larger faces will take some -->
<!-- thinking.  Say the hull contains a face with vertices v1,v2,v3,v4. All -->
<!-- these points are co-planar. We check v1v2v3 and output it as a -->
<!-- face. We check v1v2v4 and putput it as a face. We check v2v3v4 and -->
<!-- output it as a face. ALso v1v3v4 and output is as a face. Therefore -->
<!-- we'll have overlapping triangles covering one non-triangular face. -->
<!-- We got a problem. -->
<!-- Can we come up with an easy solution?  -->



<h4>Going from naive to gift wrapping or incremental</h4>




<p>In addition to the hull faces, you may need to keep track of what vertices
are on the hull. For gift wrapping, you'll need to keep track of what
edges are on the hull and  whether an edge has
found both its adjacent faces or only one of them. Come up with
structures to keep track of these.  Consider using hash tables and maps
and trees.  As mentioned, avoid storing a topological structure for the
hull (to avoid the complexity or programming).

<p>For gift wrapping, for example, you'll want to keep a queue/stack that
stores all the edges that are on the frontier of the search (in other
words: all edges that have found only one adjacent face so far). When
you add a face between an edge e=(p1, p2) on the frontier of the hull,
and a new vertex p, this will create two edges (p1,p) and (p2,p). This
may be edges already on the frontier of the hull, or new
edges. Therefore you'll need to be able to <i>search</i> the frontier
of the hull efficiently; that is, the structure you use to store the
frontier of the hull should support search. 

<p>For incremental:you'll want to find all faces that are visible from
the next point, p. Doing a linear search  through the faces of the
hull and checking visibility is totally fine.

<p><b>Orienting a face:</b> All faces on the hull should be oriented
so that the normal to the face points outside the hull; that is, all
points p in P are behind the face.

Given a face (a,b,c), you can orient it as (a,b,c) or (a,c,b). How do
you know which one to choose? Consider an arbitrary point p in P,
different than a,b,c.  If p is behind face (a,b,c) then (a,b,c) is the
correct orientation. Otherwise, the correct orientation is (a,c,b).



<p><b>Degeneracies:</b> If there exist sets of 4 or more points that
are co-planar, it is possible that faces in the hull are not
triangular. Whichever algorithm you implement, consider how it can be
extended to handle degeneracies. Ideas: keep non-triangular faces; or,
split non-triangular faces into triangles. 




<p><b>Base code:</b>
Base code is provided with the assignment's GitHub repository.

The code should compile as is, but it does not do anything besides
the interface. You need to add a function that computes the hull (and
a function that renders the faces of the hull). 


<p><b>Test cases:</b> Please provide one interesting test case
(configuration of points) on which to compute the hull.  Post your
special test case on Slack, so that everyone can see it. Include at least
three of your classmates test cases in your code. 

<p><b>Share!</b> Use Slack!  Share anything that you stumble on, and
anything you learn while working on the project. And if it's late at
night and you got a bug and your code does not compile, feel free to
ramble --we're in this together. 


<p><b>Extra features:</b>

Some ideas: 
<ul>

<li>Figure out how to draw transparent, and draw the hull faces
transparent so that we can "see inside".

<li>Make an animation (like the hull turning
around) [legacy OpenGL: Use a timerfunc()]

</ul> 


<p><b>Additional resources:</b>

If you want to check out details of the algorithms, the first source is
the chapter on 3d hulls in the textbook by O'Rourke. Note that it has a
complete implementation of the incremental algorithm. Since it's the
textbook, it's fine if you use as little or as much of this
implementation as you want.

<!-- >For gift wrapping, the original paper that proposed the algorithm is by Chan and Kapur 1970:  -->
<!-- <a href="Chan-Kapur-1970-AnALgorithmForConvexPolytopes.pdf">Chan-Kapur-An-algorithm-for -->
<!-- convex polytopes</a>(1970). I searched for it while looking for how to -->
<!-- find the first face on the hull.  Here is an excerpt on how to find -->
<!-- the <a href="firstface.png">first face</a> on the hull. -->

<p>For gift wrapping, the only part we didn't spell out is how to find
the first face on the hull. Feel free to search and reach out to me if
you cannot find an answer.

<p><b>Work in style: </b>

As usual, you need to strive to write not merely code, but simple,
elegant and easy to understand code. Furthermore, you need tow strive
to do this out of habit, as you start programming, and not only at the
end. Writing good code has to become your second nature.  Write good
code not because you have to, but because you don't know anyt other
way. 
 



<p><b>What and  how to turn in:</b>o

You will receive the assignment on GitHub, including the startup
code. 

You are encouraged to do pair-programming, but feel free to work
alone. 

Push your code into your github repository for this
assignment. 

Provide a README that describe the state of your code (does it work on
all test cases, do you know of any bugs, any extra features).




<h2>Enjoy!</h2>
