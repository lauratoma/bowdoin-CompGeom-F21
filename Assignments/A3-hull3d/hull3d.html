<h2>Assignment:  3d hull</h2>





<p> Write code (in C/C++) to compute the convex hull of a set of
points in 3D using either the incremental algorithm, or gift wrapping.


<p><b>Starting naive:</b>
Start by implementing the naive algorithm.  It shoud provide a nice
motivation for getting the basics working.


For simplicity, do not worry about storing the topology of the hull,
that is, the neighboring information for its faces, edges and
vertices. Store the hull as an array/vector of faces.

Also, do not worry about handling degeneracies. 

To test, generate points randomly on the sphere, and compute their
convex hull.


<!-- <p><b>Degeneracies: </b> If there exist 4 points that are coplanar and -->
<!-- extreme, they will lead to a face of the hull that is a polygon with -->
<!-- more than 3 vertices.  Handling these larger faces will take some -->
<!-- thinking.  Say the hull contains a face with vertices v1,v2,v3,v4. All -->
<!-- these points are co-planar. We check v1v2v3 and output it as a -->
<!-- face. We check v1v2v4 and putput it as a face. We check v2v3v4 and -->
<!-- output it as a face. ALso v1v3v4 and output is as a face. Therefore -->
<!-- we'll have overlapping triangles covering one non-triangular face. -->
<!-- We got a problem. -->
<!-- Can we come up with an easy solution?  -->


<p><b>Going from naive to gift wrapping or incremental:</b>
A big question will be: what sort of structure do you need to store
the hull? At the very least the hull will need to store its faces (an
array/vector of faces on the hull).  Ideally the faces use pointers to
the points, rather than duplicating the points and their coordinates.
For example: 

<pre>
typedef struct _face3d {
   point3d *p1, *p2, *p3;  //the vertices on this face (in ccw as looking from outside)
} face3d; 
</pre>


<p>In addition to the faces, you may need to keep track of what vertices
are on the hull, what edges are on the hull, and whether an edge has
found both its adjacent faces or only one of them. Come up with
structures to keep track of these.  Consider using hash tables and maps
and trees and such, and avoid storing a topological structure for the
hull (to avoid the complexity or programming).

For example you may want to keep a queue/stack that stores all the
edges that are on the frontier of the search (in other words: all
edges that have found only one adjacent face so far).



<p><b>Degeneracies:</b> If there exist sets of 4 or more points that
are co-planar, it is possible that faces in the hull are not
triangular. Whichever algorithm you implement, consider how it can be
extended to handle degeneracies.





<p><b>Base code:</b>
Base code is provided with the assignment's GitHub repository.

The code should compile as is, but it does not do anything besides
the interface. You need to add a function that computes the hull, and
a function that renders the faces of the hull. 


<p>Test cases: As with the previous assignment, please provide one
interesting test case (configuration of points) on which to compute
the hull.  Every team, please email your special test_cases to the
whole class on piazza, so that everyone can include everyone's test
cases in their code.

<p><b>Share!</b> Use piazza!  Share on piazza anything that you stumble on, and
anything you learn while working on the project, so that the
whole class can benefit.


<p><b>Extra features:</b>

Some ideas: 
<ul>

<li>Figure out how to draw transparent, and draw the hull faces
transparent so that we can "see inside".

<li>Use a timerfunc() to make an animation (like the hull turning
around).

</ul> 



<p><b>Work in style: </b>

As usual, you need to strive to write not merely code, but simple,
elegant and easy to understand code. Furthermore, you need to strive
to do this out of habit, as you start programming, and not only at the
end. Writing good code has to become your second nature.  Write good
code not because you have to, but because you don't know any other
way. 


<p>People often disagree what consitutues elegant when it comes to
coding, but everyone agrees on the following:

<ul>
  <li>structure your code into small functions with intuitive
  arguments that allow you to test your code incrementally after every
  function you add
  
  <li>code should be well documented, ideally at block level but
  certainly at function level.  Every function should have a header
  specifying what are the expected input values, what is the return value, and what
  does the function actually do. 

  <li>no function should be longer than a screen

  <li>code should be accompanied by a README tha details how to run
  it, and whether there are any known bugs that the user shoud be
  aware of 

  <li>[insert here all style guidelines that you know from pevious classes]
</ul>


<p>How do you know if you write good code? My theory is that the the
quality of your code is directly proportional to how easy and
enjoyablet is to debug and update/extend your code.  If you find
debugging is frustrating and like searching a needle in a haystack,
then your code style is probably not that good.



<p><b>What and  how to turn in:</b>

You will receive the assignment on GitHub, including the startup
code. 

You are encouraged to do pair-programming, but feel free to work
alone. 

Push your code into your github repository for this
assignment. 

Provide a README that describe the state of your code (does it work on
all test cases, do you know of any bugs, any extra features).




<h2>Enjoy!</h2>
