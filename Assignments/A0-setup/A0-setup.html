<h3>Slack setup</h3>

We'll be using <a href="https://www.slack.com">Slack</a> for
communication outside of class.  If this is your first time using
Slack, worry not --- you'll pick it up quickly and there's a good
chance you'll use it beyond Bowdoin.

The advantage of using Slack over email is that it keeps all messages in one place, it's
easy to keep conversations organized, and has a lot more cool options
to facilitate communication and team-building.

Compared to the discussion forum
in Blackboard -- Slack is more versatile and if you download the
desktop app (encouraged), it works like an email app; you stay logged
in and it notifies you when there are new nessages. 

<p>I do not plan to use email at all for communication, and will send all
class annoucements via Slack. I encourage everyone to do the same. If
you want to send me a private  message, Slack has the option of a
"direct message (DM)". You can DM me, or anyone else in the class. And
you can create your own channels, which can be private, to which you
can invite your team mates (for e.g. when team-working on a project!
really cool feature!). 

I created three channels: #class (for all class communication and file
sharing), #assignments (for all assignment-related communication),
#general (for general announcements), and #random (for everything else).


<ol>

  <li> Start by reading/watching a start guide: 
  <a
  href="https://slack.com/help/articles/360059928654-How-to-use-Slack--your-quick-start-guide??&utm_source=hppromo&utm_medium=promo">How
  to use Slack: Your quick start guide</a>

  <p><li>Go to Blackboard, enter this course, and you'll find a
  signup link for Slack. Use it  and sign up (using your bowdoin
  email).

  <p><li>You can access Slack via the web interface, but I encourage you
  to download the <a href="https://slack.com/downloads/">Slack desktop app</a>; it works like
  an email client and you'll be able to see notifications right away.
  There is also a Slack mobile app.

  <p><li><a
  href="https://slack.com/help/articles/201355156-Configure-your-Slack-notifications">Configure
  your Slack notifications</a> Set your notifications to "All new
  messages". At the bottom of the Notifications preferences, under
  "When I'm not active on desktop", you may want to check the "Send me
  email notifications" box, particularly if you might otherwise not be
  signed into Slack on a regular basis.

  <p><li><font color="green">Once you are into Slack, send a hello
  message  to class and a short introduction  (use the
  #class channel), and send me a quick DM.</font>

<h3>Compiling and running a C/C++ program from the terminal</h3>

Follow these <a
href="_basics.html">steps</a>
to create a Hello World program, and compile it and run it from the
terminal. 

<p>Nothing to submit, just warmup.  If you run into problems, post on Slack!

<h3>Unix crash course</h3>

Go through the <a
href="https://tildesites.bowdoin.edu/~sbarker/unix/">Unix crash
course</a> maintained by my colleague Sean Barker (except for the
version control section at the very end).

You don't need to know everything upfront, but starting week 2 being
familiar will greatly help.

<p>Nothing to submit.  As always, if you run into problems, post
on Slack!

<h3>Version Control with <Tt>Git</Tt></h3>


<p>Some of you may be familiar with  <tt>Git</tt> and <tt>Github</tt> from
csci2330: Systems. If so, go quickly over this section to refresh your
memory and make sure you don't miss anything.

If this is the first time you see <tt>Git</tt>, you may want to check
out the detailed <a
href="https://tildesites.bowdoin.edu/~sbarker/unix/git.html">Git
tutorial</a> maintained by Sean Barker.



<p><a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a> is an open-source, distributed
    version control software, initially developed by Linus Torvalds
    for Linux. <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> implements a web-based
    version of <tt>git</tt> where users, in addition to using <tt>git</tt> commands,
    can store their repositories "into the cloud". GitHub offers
    all the functionality of <tt>git</tt> plus extra features (like wiki pages
    for each project; networking features like feeds and
    followers). GitHub has 20+ million users, and it's become a
    virtual meeting place for software developpers, for sharing
    information and showcasing projects.


<p><strong>How it works, in a nutshell: </strong> With Github you and
your peers can work together on projects from anywhere in the
world. Initially you (or someone else) will create a remote master
repository for your project. This master repository is
hosted remotely, on github. You (and your partners, if any) will then
clone (checkout) a private copy of the remote master repository on
your local machine. You can clone several copies of the master repo in
several locations, if you want.

You can make changes to your local copy. When you are done, you stage
these changes for commit, and then you push them to the master
repository. Once your changes are pushed to the master repo, your
partners can get them by "pulling" the changes from the master repo
into their local repo. <Tt>Git</Tt> automatically merges the changes pulled
form the master with the local changes in the local repo. <Tt>Git</Tt> keeps a
record of all changes, and any change can be reverted.


<p>To start, create a Github account, if you don't have one already.
 Before you starting using the <Tt>Git</Tt> command on the command line, you
need to give it a basic configuration. This will tell <Tt>Git</Tt> who you are,
making it easy for you and your partners to identify who committed code
to your shared repository.

Replace the email and name strings with your email address and
name. If you have not run these commands, then the very first <Tt>Git</Tt>
commit will fail and tell you to run them.

<pre>
git config --global user.email "username@bowdoin.edu"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global push.default simple
</pre>


<h4>Set up authentication with SSH-key</h4>

With Github you can authenticate with a password, or with an SSH-key;
  the latter is more secure and might become required, so it's worth
  taking the time to set it up.

<p>To authenticate using an SSH-key, a user must have an SSH-key pair
on their local computer.  An SSH-key consists of a private key and a
public key. The public key can be shared with anyone, and the private
key needs to be kept confidential (just like a password).

<p>How it works:
<ul>
  <li>
  When the user (the client) wants to connect to the
server (the host) vis SSH-key authentication, it will send her public
key to the host.

  <li>The host will will generate a random string and it will encrypt
it with using the public key. This encrypted message can only be
decrypted with the associated private key.

  <li>The host will send this encrypted message to the user's client
to test whether they actually have the associated private key.

  <li>The client will decrypt the message using the private key and
obtain the random string, and send it back to the host.

  <li>The server compares the string received from the client with the
  original string, and determines whether the client has the private
  key.

  </ul>
  

  <p>Setting up SSH-key authentication in Github: 
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Check to see if you have an SSH-key and if not,
    generate one: </strong>
    
    <br>If you have
    one, it must be in <tt>~/.ssh/</tt>; If you see an
    <tt>id_rsa.pub</tt> file, or something like this, it means you already have a public key. If
    you don't see one, then generate one.
    
    To generate an SSH-key: In the terminal, use the
    <tt>ssh-keygen</tt> command. SSH keys are 2048 bits by default; To
    specify a larger number of bits, include the <tt>-b</tt> argument
    followed by the number of bits you would like. We'll use 4096 as
    per Githib's recommendation. 

    <pre>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "youremail@bowdoin.edu" </pre>
    
  This uses the RSA algorithm and creates a new public/private SSH key
  pair on your computer, using the provided email as a label.  When it
  prompts you to enter a file to save the key, press Enter to accept
  the default. AT the next prompt, type a secure passphrase.

  A passphrase should be hard to guess, have at least 15 characters,
  contain a combination if letters and diGits and punctuation
    characters.

    
  <p>This has generated an RSA SSH key pair, located in the
  <tt>.ssh</tt> hidden directory in your home directory.  These files
  are:

  <pre>~/.ssh/id_rsa    <------------ the private key. DO NOT SHARE!!!
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub   <--------- the associate public key. This can be shared freely 
</pre>


    <p><li><strong>Configure your SSH-client  on the machine from where you
    connect to Github, to use your SSH-key for authentication:</strong>

    <br>To do that, modify your <tt>~/.ssh/config</tt> file to
    automatically load keys into the SSH-agent and store passphrases
    in your keychain. You can do this with your favorite editor (for
    e.g. <tt>nano, atom, emacs, vim </tt>). If this file does not
    exist, you need to create it.

<pre>
Host github.com
   AddKeysToAgent yes
   UseKeychain yes
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
</pre>

 If you had to create your SSH config file, you'll also need to set the file permissions appropriately:

    <pre>
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
    </pre>



    <p><li><strong>Configure Github  to use your SSH-key for
authentication:</strong>

<br> To do that go to you GitHub  account page.  In the upper-right corner, click
your profile photo and click Settings.  Click SSH and GPG keys. Click
"New SSH key". In the In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label
for the new key. For example, if you're using a personal Mac, you
might call this key "Personal MacBook Air".

Paste in the contents of your public key file (not your private key
file!). You can display the contents of your public key file, assuming
that your public key is named ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub:

<pre>
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
</pre>

Paste the output of that command (using your actual filename) into the Key field of the GitHub settings page, then click Add SSH key.


  </ol>

  You are now all set to use SSH-key authentication with GitHub.

  When you clone a project, you'll need to go to the GitHub
repository code page and copy the SSH URL rather than HTTPS (it will look something like
git@github.com/some-organization/some-repo-name - don't change any
part of this). Use this URL in your initial clone command, and you
should never need to enter a username or password for GitHub. Note
that you may need to enter "yes" to accept the key the first time you
run a <tt>git</tt> command that uses the key (most likely the initial <tt>git</tt>
clone).
  
</ol>


<h4>Working with Git/Github</h4>


  If you work on an existing repository (this will be the case for the
  assignments in this class), you'll start by <b>cloning</b> the
  master repository. You'll receive a link for a GitHub repository
  that cintains starter code. For example, here is a repository
  which holds a <tt>Helloworld</tt> program:


  <pre>git@github.com:lauratoma/helloworld.git</tt></pre>

  First you will go to the path where you want to place your local
directory. For example, I have a directory called <tt>CompGeom</tt> on
my Desktop: 
<pre>
cd ~/Desktop/CompGeom
</pre>

 Now clone it: 

  <pre>
git clone git@github.com:lauratoma/helloworld.git
</pre>

This will create a folder called helloworld, with a file hello.c
inside it.

<pre>
cd helloworld
ls
hello.c
README.md
</pre>


Once cloned, the usual work cycle in Git is <strong>pull-add-commit-push:</strong>

<ul>

  <li>Always start by pulling the most recent version from
  the master (if you don't have a partner, this is not necessary
  unless you pushed changes from a different repo; but it's always
  safe to do it and it is good practice).
 
<pre>
cd ~/Desktop/helloworld
git pull
</pre>

  Now your local repo is sync-ed with the master repo.
  
  <p><li>Now you can start working on the project: edit existing files
  and create new files.  When you are done do a <tt>git status</tt> to
  find out the status of your repo: <pre> git status </pre> this will
  show you what files are modified. Now stage the files that you want
  to commit. For example let's say you modified
  <tt>hello.c</tt>. You'll want to stage it:

  
  <pre>
git add hello.c
</pre>

Note: You should never add object files (.o files) and executables to the repo. 
  
  <p><li>Commit to your local repo: 

  <pre>
git commit -m "describe what the changes represent"
</pre>

  Note that <tt>commit</tt> does not take file names as arguments, and will
  update the local repo with the files that have been staged. Files
  that have not been specifically staged for commit, will not be
  commited.

  <p><li>Push the changes to the master repo: 

<pre>
git push 
</pre>
</ul>

Again, <tt>git push</tt>  does not take file names as arguments; it will
sync the master repo with the commited files in the local repo.


<p>There are more advanced featured of <tt>git</tt> which you may or may
not need later, like  branching, resolving merge conflicts, 
reversing changes, deleting files, and more  ---- we'll figure those out later when the need
arises. For now these basics commands will suffice.
