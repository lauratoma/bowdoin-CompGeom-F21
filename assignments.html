<title>Computational Geometry: Assignments</title>
</head>

<h2>Assignments</h2> 


     
<p>How to submit: You will receive each assignment on Github.  Links
to the GitHub respositories for each  assignments will be sent via Piazza. You
will need to follow the link to accept the assignment. To submit, you
don't need to do anything --- simply make sure your code on Github is up to
date.  I will check it out.

<p>Like with any github repo, make sure you update the README with
basic information on what the code is doing and how to run it.

<p> Grading: The assignmenst will be weighed equally (so in effect each
one is worth approx. 14.3% of the final grade).
